We aim to take everyone who wants to attend this workshop, however our
resources to provide interactive help is limited.  Thus,

- We accept as many Nordic participants as we can
- *Everyone* may "bring your own breakout room": 4-5 learners and one
  helper.  The helper is responsible for guiding the learners through
  the exercises.

For more details, see information at right.

### Format

Hands-on informal and interactive online event with type-along type of
presentations, live coding and demos. Short tutorials alternate with practical
exercises.

Online workshop, three half-days a week for two weeks, covering the full
range of CodeRefinery lessons.



### Course goals

The aim of this course is to demonstrate to and familiarize the workshop
participants with best practices and tools for version control in modern
research software development. The main focus is on using Git for efficiently
writing and maintaining research software.


### **Software requirements**

Please follow the links below and make sure that you install all the required software packages
([why we ask you to do this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation page.

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some configuration
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)

**You should try to do this on your on, but then you must verify your
setup before the workshop: a) If you are part of a team (see
right), your helper should check your setup  b) Otherwise, join one of
the "setup check" sessions below.**
