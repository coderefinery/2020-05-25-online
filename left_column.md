### May 25-27 and June 2-4, 9:00-12:00 CEST

<a class="btn btn-danger disabled" href="#" data-mode="1"
target="_blank">We are full, see below</a>

**We are full with over 130 people!  We will try to make more spaces
available by live
streaming.  Helpers are still needed and can still register, see
below.**  This is a developing situation
(2020-05-13), please check back for more information.

* **We still need helpers**, they may still register <a href="https://indico.neic.no/event/141/registrations/66/">here</a>.

* **I'm part of a team, some people had time to register but some
  didn't.**  Contact us by email (below) and we'll help.

* **Is there any way I can follow along?**  We'll try to live stream
  it, see below.  The experience won't be the same, but we do what we
  can.

* **If it's online, why did you close?**  CodeRefinery workshops are
  interactive, with lots of interaction between instructors, helpers,
  and learners.  We can scale one-to-many easily, but we reached the
  limits of an interactive format.

* **When are registrations approved?**  We will look through number
  of attendees and number of helpers, and accept who we can and direct
  the rest to the live stream.

* **How can I be notified of updates?**  Currently, we don't have any
  way.  Follow [@coderefine](https://twitter.com/coderefine) on
  Twitter.

Please see information at right for registration options: learner or
helper, and individual or as a team.

Because of our Nordic funding, priority is for Nordic participants.
This is the first Mega-CodeRefinery, so we reserve the right to make
changes.  Everyone gets added to a waitlist initially, and we
approve people as we get space.  Check
back for updates.


### Live streaming

See [right bottom â†’](#streaming-info)


### Course goals and format

In this course, you will become familiar with tools and best practices
for version control in modern research software development. The main
focus is on using Git for efficiently writing and maintaining research
software.  We don't teach programming, but we teach the tools you need
to use programming well.

This is an informal and interactive online event with type-along type
of presentations, live coding, and demos. Short tutorials alternate
with practical exercises.

We might live stream or record (part of ) the workshop to reach an
even wider audience.  In this case, privacy is our first concern and
*only* the instructor's video will be published, and *breakout rooms
for exercises are completely private*.  More details will come later.


### Software requirements

You need to install some software *before* CodeRefinery ([why we ask
you to do
this](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/#why-are-we-asking-participants-to-install-software)).
Please do this - *and check it* - in advance, otherwise you'll start off
behind.

Note that, e.g., a working Python executable on your laptop is not sufficient -
a version greater than 3.4 is strongly recommended and a number of extra
packages need to be installed as detailed on the Python installation
page.  **You also need to check your git configuration.**  **If you
have an institutional laptop with limited rights, start in advance
and/or ask for help to translate these instructions to work on your system.**

- [Bash](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/bash/)
- [Editor](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/editors/)
- [Git](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/git/), including
  some configuration
- [(optional) Visual diff tools](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/difftools/)
- [Python](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/python/)
- [Jupyter and JupyterLab](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/jupyter)
- [Snakemake](https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/snakemake)

**You should either a) drop by one of our verification sessions in
advance, or b) verify with your team's helper before the workshop.**


### Schedule

The schedule includes frequent breaks.  All times are in Central
European Summer Time.  [Convert 9:00 CEST to your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Stockholm/2020-05-25/09:00/CodeRefinery%20online#eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NvZGVyZWZpbmVyeS5naXRodWIuaW8vMjAyMC0wNS0yNS1vbmxpbmUvIn0=).
