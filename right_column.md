### Price

Free of charge.


### Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you.  Most participants are not
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, join us as a helper! It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.

### How to join

Welcome to the first online mega-CodeRefinery.  This is "mega" because
historically, we have been limited by physical space or number of
helpers.  We want take direct action to reach as many people as possible.

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus:

- Anyone may register as a learner, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Or you can register as a helper
- Register as a team, one helper and 4-5 learners.
  - We will accept all complete teams
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.
  - Decide some team name, and when registering, everone enter this
    same name so that we can link you together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Instructors provide advance training and drop by to check and help
    as needed.


### Prerequisites

- You should be able to navigate the file tree in a terminal session and edit
  text files in the terminal.
  [This Linux shell crash course](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell.html)
  ([video](https://youtu.be/56p6xX0aToI))
  contains the essentials.
- Basics in one or more programming languages.
- You will need to bring a laptop.
- If this is an in-person workshop, it is good if you have access to Eduroam.
- You need to install some software. Please follow links in the schedule.
- It is useful if you have a basic idea of how Git works. We will start from
  the basics, but please go through
  [this Git-refresher material](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/)
  for a basic overview and important configuration steps.
